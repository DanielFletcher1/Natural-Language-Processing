#Exploratory analysis introduction
The purpose of this paper is to give some very brief findings from my introductory exploration of the SwiftKey data set and solicit feedback on my plans to build a SwiftKey-like text prediction model.

As this paper is written to be understood by a "non data scientist," all of the code I executed is hidden from view and may be seen here: [On GitHub](https://github.com/DanielFletcher1/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/master/msReport.Rmd)

twords <- sum(m[,3]) #Total twitter words

```

#Analyzing the data and detecting words
In order to considerably reduce computing time (I understand many classmates have taken hours for some processing on *high-end* machines), I've taken relatively small, simple random samples (~5%) of the three English files provided for this project: `en_US.blogs.txt`, `en_US.news.txt`, and `en_US.twitter.txt`.

Part of my analysis was to analyze how many words were in each file.  "Words" are a difficult for machines to naturally delineate because they think in 1s and 0s.  However, there are various text mining resources, such as `tm`, an add-on for the R programming tool, which help to simplify the complex question of defining and quantifying "words."

Using some data-cleaning tools from `tm` and other add-ons, I "pre-processed" the data, to ensure my computer would categorize words from the three text files close to the way a human would.

#Word counts
In my sampled version of the files, I counted approximately 1,454,413 blog words, 108,880 news words, and 1,142,112 twitter words.  I imagine the low count for news words could be due to its higher formality and lower likelihood of having terms that would not normally be considered "words," such as "00003175."

When looking at the most frequent words in the sampled files (ordered below by highest blog count), there are obviously a high number of low-context words, such as "the" and "and."  I made a conscious decision, for now, to include these common words (often called "stop words"), in case they help with my prediciton models later.  I may choose to remove them.


```{r Display Stop Words,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
bo
```

Of interest is that although many of the first hunderd most frequent words across all three files are classified by the `tm` add-on as "stopwords," about 59% of them are not, as shown in the pie chart below.

```{r Display Stop Word Pie Chart,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE}

stoplength <- length(stopwords()) #174

instop <- sum(names(v)[1:stoplength] %in% stopwords()) #72

pie(x = c(instop,stoplength),labels = c("41% Match 'Stopwords'", "59% Don't Match 'Stopwords'"),main = "Percent of Sample words that match 'Stopwords'")

```

#Line counts
Although processing all lines in the three text files for word delination can be very time-consuming and resource intensive, determining how many lines each file has is very simple and takes only 1-20 seconds, depending on the user's machine.

There are about 899,288 lines in the blogs file, 1,010,242 in the news file, and 2,360,148 in the twitter file, all as shown below.

```{r Display Line Count,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE}

b <- countLines(file = "final/en_US/en_US.blogs.txt")
n <- countLines(file = "final/en_US/en_US.news.txt")
t <- countLines(file = "final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt")

```

```{r Display Bar Plot,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,cache=TRUE}
barplot(c(b,n,t),names.arg = c("Blogs","News","Twitter"))
```

#Moving on to prediction
The most interesting and challenging aspect of this project will be solidfying my prediction model.  At the moment, my progress is shaky, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback and resources you feel inclined to share.

I still plan to use a random sample of the data for computational efficiency and later compression in my Shiny app.  However, I might increase the size of the sample to ensure better accuracy.

Thank you for your time!
